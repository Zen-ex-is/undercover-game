**Round 1 - Descriptions:**
- P1 (Civilian): "Mine is brown and has caffeine"
- P2 (Spy): "Mine is a morning drink" ← vague!
- P3 (Mr. White): "Mine is popular worldwide" ← very vague!
- P4 (Civilian): "Mine comes from beans"
- P5 (Civilian): "Mine can be iced or hot"
- P6 (Civilian): "Mine is often served at Starbucks"

**Observation:** P2 and P3 were vague, but P3 was MORE vague!
